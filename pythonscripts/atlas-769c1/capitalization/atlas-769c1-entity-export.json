    "about" : "Associates started in 2004, born out of necessity for sound project management and continuous improvement and grew rapidly after several small and mid-sized companies asked for our help in managing their critical projects within time and budgetary constraints. We evaluated their current processes and systems then introduced newer tools, methodologies, and technologies such as Lean Office, Professional Project Management, Six Sigma, multifunctional networked office products, scalable software and new procurement options.As a result, APB created a sustainable business model addressing the evolution of global supply chain management requirements, diversity and inclusion requirements in large-scale construction projects, and other regulatory and compliance issues that pose a threat to the operational success of organizations.  The model is built on the principles of project management, process improvement, and cloud-based computing and allows for flexibility in designing solutions, innovation in the delivery of services, and reliability and consistency in benchmarking and reporting.Due to our strategic business partnerships and high customer retention, the company continues to grow, offering more services, including environmental management, carbon reduction, supplier validation, and conflict minerals management. Our solutions have been widely accepted and proven in the financial, manufacturing, technology, construction, environment, healthcare, government and professional services industries.",

In 1872, under the Morrill Act, the school became the first land-grant college in the South and was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama. In 1899 the name again was changed, to the Alabama Polytechnic Institute. Finally, in 1960 the name of the school was changed to Auburn University, a title more in keeping with its location, and expressing the varied academic programs and larger curriculum of a major university.\r\n\r\nToday, Auburn is one of the few universities to carry the torch as a land, sea and space grant university. Our fall 2015 semester enrollment was 27,287. Our students can choose from more than 140 degree options in 13 schools and colleges at the undergraduate, graduate and professional levels.",

MDRC is best known for mounting large-scale demonstrations and evaluations of real-world policies and programs targeted to low-income people. We helped pioneer the use of random assignment — the same highly reliable methodology used to test new medicines — in our evaluations. From welfare policy to high school reform, MDRC’s work has helped to shape legislation, program design, and operational practices across the country. Working in fields where emotion and ideology often dominate public debates, MDRC is a source of objective, unbiased evidence about cost-effective solutions that can be replicated and expanded to scale.",

Working together with our community members, the Foundation’s efforts have led to many advances in how Trisomy 18 is understood and how health professionals respond to newly-diagnosed parents in the United States, but there is so much that still needs changing.  And the need for investments in genetic research to identify pathways to treatments has never been greater.\r\n\r\nWe tirelessly advocate for research innovations and new approaches to the search for treatments and preventions that can save lives and dramatically reduce the incidence rate of Trisomy 18 conceptions and increase survival rates.",
