Once composed primarily of college and university teachers of economics, the Association now attracts an increasing number of members from business and professional groups. Today the membership is ca. 18,000, over half of whom are academics. About 15% are employed in business and industry, and the remainder largely by federal, state, and local government or other not-for-profit organizations.",

    "about" : "Associates started in 2004, born out of necessity for sound project management and continuous improvement and grew rapidly after several small and mid-sized companies asked for our help in managing their critical projects within time and budgetary constraints. We evaluated their current processes and systems then introduced newer tools, methodologies, and technologies such as Lean Office, Professional Project Management, Six Sigma, multifunctional networked office products, scalable software and new procurement options.As a result, APB created a sustainable business model addressing the evolution of global supply chain management requirements, diversity and inclusion requirements in large-scale construction projects, and other regulatory and compliance issues that pose a threat to the operational success of organizations.  The model is built on the principles of project management, process improvement, and cloud-based computing and allows for flexibility in designing solutions, innovation in the delivery of services, and reliability and consistency in benchmarking and reporting.Due to our strategic business partnerships and high customer retention, the company continues to grow, offering more services, including environmental management, carbon reduction, supplier validation, and conflict minerals management. Our solutions have been widely accepted and proven in the financial, manufacturing, technology, construction, environment, healthcare, government and professional services industries.",

    "about" : "Auburn University was established in 1856 as the East Alabama Male College, 20 years after the city of Auburn's founding. In 1872, under the Morrill Act, the school became the first land-grant college in the South and was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama. In 1899 the name again was changed, to the Alabama Polytechnic Institute. Finally, in 1960 the name of the school was changed to Auburn University, a title more in keeping with its location, and expressing the varied academic programs and larger curriculum of a major university.\r\n\r\nToday, Auburn is one of the few universities to carry the torch as a land, sea and space grant university. Our fall 2015 semester enrollment was 27,287. Our students can choose from more than 140 degree options in 13 schools and colleges at the undergraduate, graduate and professional levels.",

Founded in 1995, the Center for Studying Health System Change (HSC) worked to fulfill a vision set out by leaders at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. That vision was based on the premise that rigorous information and analysis built up from the community level could inform national health policy making. For almost 20 years as a subsidiary of Mathematica Policy Research, HSC pursued that mission, conducting policy research and analysis focused on the U.S. health care system to help policy makers in government and private industry make better decisions.",

In 2000, those five organizations were joined by a sixth. A freestanding, not-for-profit organization, IASWR serves the research needs of the entire social work profession. Sponsoring organizations are represented on the Board of Directors of IASWR and contribute annually to its financial support.\r\nIASWR promotes social work research conducted under the auspices of other academic and professional organizations. IASWR does not conduct or fund social work research directly, except in surveys on behalf of the profession, which relate to fulfilling Institute goals.",

MDRC is best known for mounting large-scale demonstrations and evaluations of real-world policies and programs targeted to low-income people. We helped pioneer the use of random assignment — the same highly reliable methodology used to test new medicines — in our evaluations. From welfare policy to high school reform, MDRC’s work has helped to shape legislation, program design, and operational practices across the country. Working in fields where emotion and ideology often dominate public debates, MDRC is a source of objective, unbiased evidence about cost-effective solutions that can be replicated and expanded to scale.",

    "about" : "Before our founding in 2003, learning about Trisomy 18 syndrome was difficult for parents and the public—especially in the context of prenatal diagnoses for expectant parents.  Working together with our community members, the Foundation’s efforts have led to many advances in how Trisomy 18 is understood and how health professionals respond to newly-diagnosed parents in the United States, but there is so much that still needs changing.  And the need for investments in genetic research to identify pathways to treatments has never been greater.\r\n\r\nWe tirelessly advocate for research innovations and new approaches to the search for treatments and preventions that can save lives and dramatically reduce the incidence rate of Trisomy 18 conceptions and increase survival rates.",

    "about" : "VCU was founded in 1838 as the medical department of Hampden-Sydney College, becoming the Medical College of Virginia in 1854. In 1968, the General Assembly merged MCV with the Richmond Professional Institute, founded in 1917, to create Virginia Commonwealth University. Today, more than 31,000 students pursue 223 degree and certificate programs through VCU’s 13 schools and one college. The VCU Health System supports the university’s health care education, research and patient care mission. With a record $260 million in sponsored research funding last fiscal year, VCU became one of only 28 public universities in the country with an academic medical center to be designated as a research university with very high research activity as well as a Community Engaged Institution, both by the Carnegie Foundation.",
